			<h3>Blue Campaign: #WearBlueDay</h3>
			<h4>Art Direction, Digital, Social, Print</h4>
			<p>The Department of Homeland Security's Blue Campaign is a national public awareness initiative that educates the public, law enforcement, and industry partners on recognizing the indicators of human trafficking and responding appropriately. Each January, during Human Trafficking Prevention Month (HTPM), Blue Campaign hosts events and Wear Blue Day—an awareness day encouraging participants to wear blue and share images on social media.</p>
			<p>I developed this concept using the brighter colors from the Blue Campaign palette and simple illustrated characters reminiscent of social media profile pictures. Acting as art director, I led a team of designers on the DCG team to apply this concept across a suite of materials, including social and paid media, web graphics, event graphics, and print deliverables. Since Blue Campaign’s social following typically grows during HTPM, I also developed a sister style for the follow-up <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2LYXWuM4m7/" span style="text-decoration: underline">#TacklingTrafficking campaign,</a> which focused on informational and myth-busting social content.</p>
			<p>Campaign Results:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>274,582 impressions in one month (20% more than the total for the first quarter)</li>
				<li>2,898 shares in January (up 258% from December)</li>
				<li>In January, there was a magnified spike of media shares: Facebook earned 1,329 shares (which averages 414 per month); Instagram earned 1,233 shares (which averages 336); and X earned 336 shares (which averages 146)</li>
				<li>Facebook gained 893 followers, while Instagram added 578 and X obtained 329</li>
			</ul>
