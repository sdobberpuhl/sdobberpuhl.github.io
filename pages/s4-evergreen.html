			<h3>If You See Something, Say Something: General Awareness Campaign</h3>
			<h4>Art Direction, Illustration, Digital, Social</h4>
			<p>The Department of Homeland Security's "If You See Something, Say Something®" campaign is a national initiative that raises public awareness about the signs of terrorism and terrorism-related crime, encouraging people to report suspicious activity to state and local law enforcement.</p>

			<p>For SeeSay's 2024 general awareness paid media campaign, I had the opportunity to work with two incredibly talented illustrators on the DCG design team, Madison Crabtree and Parker Kim. I provided oversight throughout the development process, collaborated with the paid media team and client, and contributed to the illustration work. This campaign was designed for a wide range of platforms, including display ads, social media in-feed and story ads, and out-of-home placements. Unfortunately, DCG's contract with SeeSay ended before the campaign launched, so the work was not used. Still, I’m proud of how this campaign approached the complex and challenging subject of terrorism awareness.</p>
